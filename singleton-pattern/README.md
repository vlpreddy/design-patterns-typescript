TypeScript Design Patterns - Singleton Pattern

# In this example, the HttpClient class uses the fetch function to make HTTP requests to the REST API. The get and post methods return Promises that resolve with the JSON data returned from the API.

# To use this HTTP client, you would again call HttpClient.getInstance() to get the singleton instance, and then call the get or post method on that instance as needed.
